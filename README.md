Webpage showing some of the dishes from Mozambique
Hi, my name is Vanilo, I am from Mozambique in Africa and I am here to show you some of the typical dishes in Mozambique. If one day you come to Mozambique, you will find those dishes at every corner of it. They are delicious and some very nutritive.
This webpage is also part of my learning process developing webpages by The Odin Project and I hope you find it interesting. Cheers
Vanilo
